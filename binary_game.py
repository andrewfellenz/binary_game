# The game still needs some updates. The issues are the following:
# Game mode is still not selectable by user
# Tutorial still needs to be built
# Still needs to be ported to Android / IOS
# Still needs GUI to be made
# Needs more comments explaining functions

# Still need a way to display the HUD and Time
# Without disrupting everything else
# The main issue is with how the HUD and check_input
# functions are coupled together.

# Binary and Hex modes still need to check input
